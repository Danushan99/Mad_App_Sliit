<H1>Introduction about our Project</H1>

in this Covid-19 pandemic situation, we have facing lots of health problems and 
difficulties in the past two years. in order to do the thing easily, we are some of our 
group members decided to develop an android application. "MediOne" is a mobilebased Health application. using this application Android users can Easily book a 
doctor, Buy medicines, and Book for a scan in from the home.
There are many varieties of health apps available for purchase from app stores. 
Some are designed to help consumers make healthier choices.

With an app, patients no longer need to call your office to schedule appointments. 
Instead, in just a few taps or clicks, they can arrange visits with their doctors at a 
time that works for them. This saves both you and your patient’s time. From a clinic's 
perspective.

The “MediOne” is aimed to provide an excellent and friendly service for the users. In 
order to achieve the goal, the system provides various interfaces to facilitate their 
customers through digital responsive platforms. It reduces the operational cost and 
manual work. Customers are facilitated to place Book an order, Buy medicines for 
urgent medical needs online from the comfort of their own home. Customer can 
register themselves and create an account by providing details. And They can 
change password. Registered customers can Book through our system.
 An admin is given an account to handle administrative tasks.

An app platform is the backbone of a booking system software. It automates the 
appointment booking processes your staff may have trouble handling manually (e.g., 
entering patients’ personal details, setting up doctors’ time slots, dealing with 
paperwork, etc.). An app is also particularly helpful for tracking revisits and improving 
clinic-patient communication. This can result in less hassle when confirming, 
canceling, or rescheduling appointments. When your hospital appointment 
management system is based on an app or a web platform, you can minimize unused 
time slots. That’s because no-shows and cancellations can have a direct bearing on 
your bottom line. With an app, you can set reminders and notifications to keep noshows at bay. And even if patients miss their visits, you can reschedule back-to-back 
appointments straight away to avoid losing money due to an unused time slot

By developing a medical appointment booking system, clinics can also prevent 
overlapping appointments. They are the bane of all healthcare businesses. Double 
bookings often result from human error, and an automated solution can help prevent 
them from being made in the first place.

This is all too important to disregard amid the pandemic turmoil. You want to 
minimize the number of patients in your waiting room to ensure you meet socialdistancing requirements.
