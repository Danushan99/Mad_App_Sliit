<H1>Introduction about our Project</H1>

in this Covid-19 pandemic situation, we have facing lots of health problems and 
difficulties in the past two years. in order to do the thing easily, we are some of our 
group members decided to develop an android application. "MediOne" is a mobilebased Health application. using this application Android users can Easily book a 
doctor, Buy medicines, and Book for a scan in from the home.
There are many varieties of health apps available for purchase from app stores. 
Some are designed to help consumers make healthier choices.

With an app, patients no longer need to call your office to schedule appointments. 
Instead, in just a few taps or clicks, they can arrange visits with their doctors at a 
time that works for them. This saves both you and your patientâ€™s time. From a clinic's 
perspective.
